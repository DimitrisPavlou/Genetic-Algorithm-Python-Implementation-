# 🧬 Genetic Algorithm & Grey Wolf Optimizer

## 📌 Overview

This repository provides an **optimized implementation of the Genetic Algorithm (GA)** for both **discrete** and **continuous** function optimization.  

It also includes an implementation of the **Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO)**, a nature-inspired metaheuristic that often achieves **better and more stable results** with **fewer generations** compared to the basic GA.  

Both algorithms are implemented in **Python** and **C++**, making them flexible, efficient, and easy to adapt for a wide range of optimization problems.

## 🧬 What is a Genetic Algorithm?

A **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** is an optimization method inspired by the process of natural selection and evolution.  
Instead of directly searching for the best solution, a GA **evolves a population of candidate solutions** over multiple generations, combining:

- **Exploration** → searching broadly across the solution space  
- **Exploitation** → refining and improving good solutions

## ⚙️ Basic Functionality

1. **Initialization**  
   Generate a population of candidate solutions randomly or heuristically.  

2. **Evaluation (Fitness Function)**  
   Evaluate each candidate solution using a *fitness function*.  

3. **Selection**  
   Choose parents based on fitness.  
   - Common methods: *roulette wheel*, *tournament*, *rank-based*.  

4. **Crossover (Recombination)**  
   Combine two parents to produce offspring with mixed traits.  

5. **Mutation**  
   Apply small random changes to maintain diversity.  

6. **Replacement**  
   Replace old population members with offspring to form a new generation.  

7. **Termination**  
   Repeat until a stopping condition is met (max generations, convergence, or target fitness).
